          <h3> OVERVIEW </h3>
          <p> Rveal is the perfect alternative to shopping at big corporations and suppliers. Often, small businesses specialize in a few items so consumers find it hard to consistently shop at small businesses. However, Rveal allows all female owned small businesses to gather in one spot allowing users to shop at multiple small businesses at once. Through it's female exclusivity, Rveal empowers and supports females. </p>

          <h3> PURPOSE </h3>
          <p> Nowadays, talking to someone online is the norm. However, some people get used and we need to be careful in those situations. The PSEUDO team understands this problem and focuses the game around chatting with a fictional character to figure out how a predator may approach you</p>
